* strdiff

strdiff calculates a diffrence between two string sequences, but multi-byte is not supported.

* intdiff

intdiff calculates a diffrence between two int arrays sequences.

$ cd dtl/examples
$ make intdiff
$ ./intdiff # There are datas in intdiff.cpp
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
3 5 1 4 5 1 7 9 6 10

unidiff calculates a diffrence between two text file sequences, 
and output the difference between files with unified format.

* strdiff3

strdiff3 merges three string sequence and output the merged sequence.
When confliction occurred, dtl detects confliction, but does not specify the point of confliction.

$ cd dtl/examples
$ make strdiff3
$ ./strdiff3 qabc abc abcdef
result:qabcdef
$

* intdiff3

intdiff3 merges three integer sequence(vector) and output the merged sequence.

$ cd dtl/examples
$ make intdiff3
$ ./intdiff3
a:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 3 9 10
b:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
c:1 2 3 9 5 6 7 8 9 10
s:1 2 3 9 5 6 7 3 9 10
intdiff3 OK

* patch

patch is the test program. Supposing that there are two strings is called by A and B, 
patch translates A to B with Shortest Edit Script or unified format difference.

$ cd dtl/examples
$ make patch
$ ./patch abc abd
before:abc
after :abd
patch successed
before:abc
after :abd
unipatch successed
$

* fpatch

fpatch is the test program. Supposing that there are two files is called by A and B, 
fpatch translates A to B with Shortest Edit Script or unified format difference.

$ cd dtl/examples
$ make fpatch
